## Description

Provides common event interfaces. It is a public API that gives the user the ability to create/modify/print/etc all
available events. For different programming languages, it may be represented as a separate
package/namespace/project/library/etc. Contains the entire inheritance hierarchy, which must be repeated in all existing
APIs (which support inheritance in one way or another).
