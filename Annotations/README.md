## Description

Depending on the programming language, used to create annotations/attributes that add the necessary meta-information to
classes in the project.\
For different programming languages, it may be represented as a separate
package/namespace/project/library/etc.\
For example, you can add to this module an EventCode annotation/attribute, which
allows you to map the corresponding event class (Quote, Trade, etc.), to a code (a numeric representation of the event)
that is passed to the native functions. The set of classes can be expanded depending on needs, or not exist at all.
