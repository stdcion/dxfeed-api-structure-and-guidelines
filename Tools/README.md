## Description

A collection of tools that are useful for testing/debugging/demonstration. Functionally similar to qds-tools. Should be
published as ready-to-run artifacts, to make it easier to run/test by the support team and/or the client. It would be
convenient if it were functionally designed as a single executable file in which you could select the corresponding tool
with the command line arguments, like `tools <connect/dump/perftest/etc>`.
